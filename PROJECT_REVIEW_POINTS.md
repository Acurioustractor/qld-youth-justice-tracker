## üí° Key Context for Re-entry

### Project Philosophy
This isn't just a data dashboard - it's an **accountability tool** designed to force government transparency on youth justice spending and outcomes. Every feature should serve evidence-based advocacy.

### User Types & Needs
- **Advocates**: Campaign-ready content and verified statistics
- **Journalists**: Fact-checkable data with direct government source links  
- **Researchers**: Downloadable datasets with clear methodology
- **Public**: Clear visualization of taxpayer spending and system failures

### Current UI State
The homepage was recently simplified from complex animations to clean, functional navigation. Focus is now on **usability over flash** - each section should have a clear purpose and working functionality.
