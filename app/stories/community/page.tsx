    title: 'The Ripple Effect: One Arrest, Three Generations Destroyed',

    yearsAffected: 8,
    story: `When 14-year-old David was arrested for the third time, his grandmother Mary collapsed. She'd been raising him and his four siblings since their mother's death, working two jobs to keep them together.

David's arrests meant Mary had to take unpaid leave for court dates. She lost her cleaning job at the hospital. Without that income, they fell behind on rent. The stress triggered her diabetes, leading to hospitalization.

While Mary was in hospital, David's younger siblings were placed in different foster homes across Queensland. The family that had stayed together through death and poverty was torn apart by the justice system.

David's 16-year-old sister dropped out of school to work, trying to get stable housing so she could apply for custody of the younger ones. His 12-year-old brother, traumatized by the separation, began acting out in his foster placement.

What started as petty theft by one troubled teenager cascaded into family separation, job loss, housing instability, educational disruption, and health crises affecting 12 people across three generations.`,

    story: `In a town of 3,000 people, everyone knows everyone. When three teenagers were sent to detention in Brisbane, 750km away, the impact rippled through Charleville like a shockwave.

The Williamson family couldn't afford weekly trips to Brisbane for visits. Their son Jake, 15, spent six months without seeing family. His mother fell into deep depression. His father, a truck driver, took on dangerous extra shifts trying to pay for occasional visits, leading to a serious accident.

Jake's girlfriend, pregnant at 16, was left alone. The stress triggered premature labor. Their baby spent weeks in NICU, creating medical debt the teenage mother couldn't pay.

The local football team, already struggling for numbers, lost three players. The team folded, taking with it one of the few positive youth activities in town. Other teenagers, now with even fewer options, began getting into trouble.

The family's small business, a mechanical workshop, lost customers as the stigma of having a 'criminal family' spread. They closed after 23 years of operation, putting three more people out of work in a town with few jobs.`,

    story: `When 13-year-old Tara went to detention, her parents thought they were protecting their other children by not talking about it. They were wrong.

Tara's 8-year-old sister Emma began having nightmares, convinced she'd be 'taken away' too. Her school performance plummeted. She developed severe anxiety requiring years of therapy the family couldn't afford.

Her 10-year-old brother Liam was bullied relentlessly at school - kids called his family 'criminals' and excluded him. He began fighting back, starting his own path toward the justice system.

The 5-year-old twins didn't understand where their sister went. They were told she was 'at a special school.' When she returned, changed and traumatized, they were terrified of her violent outbursts.

Both parents took on extra work to pay legal fees, meaning less supervision for the remaining children. The family that had been close-knit became strangers living in the same house.

Ten years later, all four siblings have criminal records. What began as one child's crisis became a family legacy of justice system involvement spanning a decade.`,
