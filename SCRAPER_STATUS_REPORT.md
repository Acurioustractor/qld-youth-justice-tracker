**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Mission:** Expose hidden youth justice data for evidence-based reform

## 📊 Current Status Summary

### ✅ WORKING SCRAPERS (1/7)
- **Firecrawl Enhanced** - ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
  - Successfully scraping 4 Queensland government websites
  - Collecting youth justice mentions (8 from Courts, 32 from Police data)
  - Reliable data extraction with proper error handling
  - **Issue:** Cannot store to database due to RLS policies

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING (3/7)
- **Courts Enhanced** - Database connection issues
- **Police Enhanced** - Database connection issues  
- **RTI Enhanced** - Database connection issues

### ❌ BROKEN/NOT WORKING (3/7)
- **Budget Tracker** - URLs updated to 2025-26, needs environment fix
- **Parliament Monitor** - URL issues, no data being found
- **Youth Justice Core** - Mock data only, needs real scraping logic

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Connection Issues ✅ DIAGNOSED
- **Problem:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies blocking service key access
- **Status:** Tables exist, connections work, but inserts fail silently
- **Solution:** Manual RLS policy creation in Supabase dashboard needed

### 2. Environment Configuration ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Some scrapers missing environment variables
- **Status:** Firecrawl API key working, other env vars present
- **Solution:** Budget scraper needs .env.local path fix

### 3. URL Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- **Problem:** Budget scraper using outdated 2024-25 URLs
- **Status:** Updated to 2025-26 budget year
- **Solution:** URLs now point to current budget
