# ðŸŽ¯ Queensland Youth Justice Tracker: Evidence-Based Data Strategy

## Mission: Hold Queensland Government Accountable with Real Data

### Core Problem
Queensland has the **highest youth justice supervision rates in Australia** (175 per 10,000) and **20x Indigenous overrepresentation**, yet government accountability remains weak due to scattered, opaque data.

### Solution: Targeted Collection of Official Government Statistics

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure

#### PDF Extraction System
```python
# Target: Extract tables from court reports and QFCC publications
libraries: PyPDF2, pdfplumber, tabula-py
capabilities: 
  - Table extraction from annual reports
  - Statistical data parsing
  - Indigenous overrepresentation metrics
  - Cost and budget figure extraction
```

#### Open Data API Integration
```javascript
// Target: Queensland Open Data Portal structured datasets
const API_BASE = 'https://www.data.qld.gov.au/api/3/action'
endpoints:
  - datastore_search (for CSV data)
  - package_show (for dataset metadata)
  - resource_show (for resource details)
```

#### Government Report Monitoring
```javascript
// Target: Automated detection of new reports
monitoring:
  - QFCC publications RSS/updates
  - AIHW report release schedule
  - Parliamentary tabling alerts
  - Court annual report cycles
```

### Phase 2: Database Schema for Accountability

#### Indigenous Overrepresentation Tracking
```sql
CREATE TABLE indigenous_overrepresentation (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    year INTEGER,
    age_group VARCHAR(20),
    indigenous_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    overrepresentation_factor DECIMAL(5,2),
    source_document VARCHAR(500),
    court_region VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Government Accountability Metrics
```sql
CREATE TABLE accountability_failures (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    failure_type VARCHAR(100), -- 'policy_gap', 'cost_transparency', 'implementation'
    description TEXT,
    government_promise TEXT,
    actual_outcome TEXT,
    source_document VARCHAR(500),
    date_identified DATE,
    severity_score INTEGER, -- 1-10 impact scale
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Cost Transparency Tracking
```sql
CREATE TABLE detention_costs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    year INTEGER,
    cost_per_day_official DECIMAL(10,2),
    cost_per_day_true DECIMAL(10,2), -- including hidden costs
    cost_source VARCHAR(200),
    transparency_gap DECIMAL(10,2),
    youth_population INTEGER,
    total_annual_cost DECIMAL(15,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Phase 3: Accountability Dashboard

#### Real-Time Government Performance Scorecards
- Indigenous overrepresentation trends (target: reduce 20x factor)
- Watch house detention abuse tracking
- Policy promise vs delivery gaps
- Cost transparency violations
- Recidivism rate accountability (74% failure rate)

#### Evidence-Based Advocacy Tools
- Parliamentary submission generators
- Media fact-check databases  
- Timeline of government failures
- Comparative analysis (QLD vs other states)
