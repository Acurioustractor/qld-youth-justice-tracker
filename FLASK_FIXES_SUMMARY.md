### 2. Flask App Initialization
- Fixed circular import issues in `src/flask_dashboard/__init__.py`
- Added proper error handling for app initialization
- Changed async_mode from 'eventlet' to 'threading' for better compatibility

### 3. Database Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling in `get_dashboard_data()` function
- Created `get_sample_data()` function to provide fallback data when database is unavailable
- Added try-catch blocks around all database operations

### 4. Sample Data Population
- Created `src/database/populate_sample_data.py` to automatically populate empty databases
- Fixed model field mismatches in sample data creation
- Integrated sample data population into `init_db()` function

### 5. Missing Data Handling

- Added default values for all data fields
- Ensured all API responses have proper error handling

## Key Changes Made

### src/flask_dashboard/app.py
- Added proper logging configuration
- Added error handling for database connections
- Created sample data fallback mechanism
- Fixed SocketIO initialization with threading mode
- Added null checks for analyzer objects

### src/database/__init__.py
- Integrated automatic sample data population on database initialization

### src/database/populate_sample_data.py
- Created comprehensive sample data generation for all models
- Fixed field mismatches with actual database models

### requirements.txt
- Added missing Flask-related dependencies

## Testing

A test script (`test_flask_app.py`) was created to verify:
- Flask app can be imported without errors
- All routes are properly defined
- App configuration is correct
- Sample data generation works
- Database initialization succeeds

All tests are now passing successfully.

## Running the Flask Dashboard

To run the Flask dashboard:

```bash
python3 run_flask_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5555`

## Notes

- The app now handles missing database gracefully by providing sample data
- All circular imports have been resolved
- Error logging has been improved throughout
- The app can run even if some components fail to initialize
