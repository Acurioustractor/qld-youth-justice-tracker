## CRITICAL: Update Your Vercel Environment Variables

Your professional scraper system is now working perfectly locally, but you need to update Vercel with the correct Supabase credentials.

## Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/benjamin-knights-projects/qld-youth-justice-tracker/settings/environment-variables
2. Delete the old environment variables if they exist
3. Add the new correct variables

## Step 2: Add These Exact Environment Variables

**Variable Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
**Value:** `https://oxgkjgurpopntowhxlxm.supabase.co`
